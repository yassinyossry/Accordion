# 🧳 Far Away – React Packing List App

**Far Away** is a travel packing list application built as part of the [_React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann_](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/).  
The project idea and overall structure are based on the course material, while the implementation, styling, and refinements were coded independently as part of my React learning journey.

## ✨ Features

- **Add Items**: Create new items with a description and quantity.
- **Toggle Packed Items**: Mark items as packed or unpacked.
- **Sorting Options**:
  - By order of input.
  - Alphabetically by description.
  - By packed status.
- **Delete Items**: Remove individual items or clear the entire list.
- **Statistics**: View total items and packed percentage.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and responsive design for all devices.
